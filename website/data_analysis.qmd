### GDP per Capita

### Employment to Population Ratio

The Employment-to-Population Ratio trends from 1990 to 2024 reveal significant differences across global regions, offering important insights into labor market dynamics, economic development, and structural resilience. Many earlier data points prior to 1990 were excluded due to excessive missingness, as including large numbers of N/A values would have obscured meaningful patterns. From 1990 onward, North America and East Asia & Pacific consistently maintain the highest employment-to-population ratios, reflecting stronger labor force participation and diversified economic bases. In contrast, the Middle East & North Africa region persistently shows the lowest ratios, highlighting ongoing challenges related to economic structure, gender disparities, and resource dependency. A sharp global decline is observed around 2020, corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely disrupted labor markets worldwide. Although most regions experienced some recovery in the following years, Latin America, Europe, and Central Asia have struggled to return to pre-pandemic employment levels, suggesting deeper underlying economic fragilities. Sub-Saharan Africa, on the other hand, demonstrates a relatively resilient employment pattern, likely driven by the prominence of labor-intensive informal sectors. Overall, the World Average line shows a gradual, steady decline in employment-to-population ratio over the past three decades, pointing to a global trend of declining labor market participation even amid overall economic growth.

Natural resources play a critical role in explaining these regional differences. Resource-rich economies, particularly those heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, often exhibit lower employment-to-population ratios despite high per capita income levels. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as the "resource curse," occurs when wealth generated from natural resources concentrates in capital-intensive industries that do not require large labor forces, thereby limiting broader job creation. In the Middle East and North Africa, for example, the oil sector drives national revenues but does not absorb a significant share of the working-age population, especially women, resulting in structurally low employment rates. In contrast, regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture and extractive industries dominate, maintain relatively higher employment-to-population ratios, albeit often through low-wage and informal employment rather than high-productivity jobs. East Asia and North America's higher ratios suggest that diversified economies — those balancing industry, services, and technology — are better able to sustain broad employment opportunities and adapt to global shocks like COVID-19. These trends underscore the importance of economic diversification for achieving inclusive growth. Research from the World Bank (2021), the International Labour Organization (2020), and Sachs and Warner (1995) supports the conclusion that relying solely on resource wealth without broader economic development can hinder long-term labor market health and resilience.

### GDP Growth

The next indicator that we are interested in analyzing is GDP growth. In order to analyze this variable, we first did data cleaning using SQLite. We removed unneeded variables, cleaned variable names, and joined our GDP growth indicator with the country metadata. Then, we removed entries where there was no region. This is because the `country_name` column also contained regions, income levels, and world averages and to avoid redundancy with our joined data, we removed it. Lastly, we pivotted the table into a long format where instead of each year having it's own column, there is a year column and then a GDP growth column to capture the percentage of GDP growth for every year. After cleaning was completed, some simple descriptive statistics tables were created using SQLite which can be seen below. After that, python was used to create visualizations to support further analysis. The main questions we were trying to answer through the analysis of GDP growth was how GDP growth had changed over time between different regions and income levels compared to the world average. The code used to complete this analysis is located in the scripts file of this gtihub repository [here](https://github.com/Daniel2814/qtm350_finalproj/tree/d5262c78c7946d1de2ea87f036598ffe62cc3b17/scripts).
