title: "Economic Development Analysis"

This data is from the [World Bank's World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). We will be utilizing a variety of economic development indicators to conduct this analysis. Our main indicators are `GDP per capita`, `employment to population ratio`, `GDP growth`, and `Davis's Indicator`:

* **`GDP per capita`**

* **`employment to population ratio`**

The employment-to-population ratio measures the proportion of a countryâ€™s working-age population that is currently employed. It reflects the share of people aged 15 and older who are participating in the labor market by holding a job. A higher employment-to-population ratio indicates that a larger percentage of the population is contributing to economic production, while a lower ratio suggests that many individuals are either unemployed, not actively seeking work, or otherwise outside the labor force. This metric is critical for understanding the relationship between labor markets and economic development. This variable is named `L.EMP.TOTL.SP.ZS.` and can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.ZS.). For analysis, we also utilized country metadata that contained information on `region`.  

In the context of economic development, the employment-to-population ratio serves as an important indicator of how well an economy is utilizing its human resources. A rising ratio typically suggests positive development trends, such as increasing job creation, greater access to employment opportunities, and improved living standards. Economies with consistently high employment-to-population ratios often experience broader economic growth, higher productivity, and reduced poverty rates. Conversely, a low ratio can signal structural problems like weak labor market demand, gender disparities in employment, or a mismatch between skills and job opportunities. Natural resource dependence can also influence this ratio: in countries heavily reliant on oil or mining, wealth may be generated without widespread employment, leading to lower overall participation rates despite high national incomes. Thus, analyzing changes in the employment-to-population ratio over time offers key insights into the inclusiveness and sustainability of economic growth. 

* **`GDP growth`** is a variable that captures the annual percent growth of GDP for countries from 1960 to 2023. More specifically, in the World Development Indicators, this variable is named `NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG.` and can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG). For analysis, we also utilized country metadata that contained information on `region` and `income level`.

* **`Davis's Indicator`**
