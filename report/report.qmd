## Introduction



## Data Description

This data is from the [World Bank's World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). We will be utilizing a variety of economic development indicators to conduct this analysis. Our main indicators are `GDP per capita`, `employment to population ratio`, `GDP growth`, and `Davis's Indicator`:
* **`GDP per capita`**
* **`employment to population ratio`**
* **`GDP growth`** is a variable that captures the annual percent growth of GDP for countries from 1960 to 2023. More specifically, in the World Development Indicators, this variable is named `NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG.` and can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG). For analysis, we also utilized country metadata that contained information on `region` and `income level`.  
* **`Davis's Indicator`**

## Data Analysis

### GDP per Capita

### Employment to Population Ratio

### GDP Growth
    The next indicator that we are interested in analyzing is GDP growth. In order to analyze this variable, we first did data cleaning using SQLite. We removed unneeded variables, cleaned variable names, and joined our GDP growth indicator with the country metadata. Then, we removed entries where there was no region. This is because the `country_name` column also contained regions, income levels, and world averages and to avoid redundancy with our joined data, we removed it. Lastly, we pivotted the table into a long format where instead of each year having it's own column, there is a year column and then a GDP growth column to capture the percentage of GDP growth for every year. After cleaning was completed, some simple descriptive statistics tables were created using SQLite which can be seen below. After that, python was used to create visualizations to support further analysis. The main questions we were trying to answer through the analysis of GDP growth was how GDP growth had changed over time between different regions and income levels compared to the world average.
