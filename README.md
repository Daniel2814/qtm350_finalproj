# QTM350 FINAL PROJECT Economic Development and Natural Resources

This site was created for QTM 350's final project for Spring 2025. It was created by Davis Boor (2556176), Emma Jinright (2488724), Daniel Nickas (2549711), and Nick Richards (2495699).

This project concerns economic development of various regions of the world. Importing the WGAPI package in Python, this project uses World Bank datasets on GDP growth, GDP per capita, and employment to population ratios to chart plots and make inferences on how various regions have developed with respect to each other. Within the write up, we use research on natural resource exports, production, and origins to connect to the data extraction and interpretation from the WGAPI python package. 

The indicactor codes are as such:

– GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$) – Indicator: NY.GDP.PCAP.KD. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.

– Employment to population ratio, 15+, total (%) – Indicator: SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.ZS. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.ZS. 

– GDP growth (annual %)– Indicator: NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG.

Though this analysis is done at surface level, one can make inferences about how natural resources within general regions affect the development of a country using the indicators mentioned previously. 

Code in this project was written on several different devices and before running, one needs to make sure their working directories are being used instead of ones written in the code itself. After that, the project should render as a quarto report with graphs and a write up.
